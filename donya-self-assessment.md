Self-assessment Donya

Here is everything that we did with Ode:
- backend with authorization; user mvc, job mvc, requireAuth middleware and deployment of the backend. 
- frontend (full-stack); Fetching jobs, updating, deleting and adding jobs, signup and login, authorization and protected routes, dynamic routing for navbar. Also deployment of the full-stack app.

### Backend code
- userController

### What Went Well
• 	JWT generation: Clean helper function  with an expiry time is a good practice.
• 	Password hashing: Using  with salt rounds () is secure and standard.
• 	Duplicate user check: Prevents duplicate usernames before creating a new user.
• 	Error handling with try/catch: Ensures errors don’t crash the server and sends JSON responses.
• 	Separation of concerns: You’ve kept signup, login, and getMe as separate controller functions—good modularity.
• 	Consistent response format: Returning  keeps responses predictable.

### What Could Be Improved
- Token Payload: Currently, you only store . You might also want to include  or  for quick access.
• 	Password Policy: Enforce stronger password rules (length, complexity).
• 	Rate Limiting: Add rate limiting on login to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Extract repeated logic (like generating token + response) into a helper function.
'''
const sendUserResponse = (res, user, statusCode = 200) => {
  const token = generateToken(user._id);
  res.status(statusCode).json({
    _id: user._id,
    username: user.username,
    name: user.name,
    token,
  });
};
'''
### Suggested Next Steps
- Add input validation with Joi or express-validator.
- Implement a centralized error handler to clean up controllers.
- Improve security with rate limiting, stronger password rules, and sanitized responses.
- Refactor repeated logic into helper functions for cleaner code.
- Expand getMe to return a safe, full user profile

### Frontend code
- EditJobPage.jsx

### What’s Working Well
- State initialization: You’ve separated each field into its own state variable, which makes the form controlled and predictable.
- Loading and error states: Good use of loading and error to handle async fetches gracefully.
- Data fetching with useEffect: Fetching the job on mount and populating form fields is correct.
- Authorization handling: Pulling the token from localStorage and attaching it to headers is a good start.
- Update flow: updateJob is cleanly separated, and you navigate back to the job page after success.
- Form structure: Each input is controlled, ensuring React has full control over the form state.

###  Improvements
- Bug fix: In catch, use err.message instead of error.message.
- State management: Too many useState hooks—consider a single jobForm object.
- Validation: Add checks for email format, numeric fields, and valid dates.
- API separation: Move fetch logic into a dedicated api.js service.
- User feedback: Replace alert with inline success/error messages.
- Token handling: Redirect to login if no token is found.
- Date formatting: Ensure API dates are sliced to YYYY-MM-DD for <input type="date">.

- jobListings
### Strengths
- Clean structure: Component is simple and easy to follow.
- State management: Uses useState for jobs and useEffect for fetching.
- Authorization: Correctly attaches token from localStorage to requests.
- Error handling: Wraps fetch in try/catch and logs errors.
- Reusable child component: Delegates rendering to JobListing, keeping this component focused.

### Improvements
- Error & Loading State
- Currently commented out. Add loading and error states to improve UX.
- Example: show a spinner or message if fetch fails.
- Token Handling
- If no token exists, fetch will fail silently. Consider redirecting to login or showing a message.
- Key Prop
- You’re using job.id, but if your backend uses MongoDB, the field is likely _id. Ensure consistency.
- Spelling
- Error message typo: "Counld not fetch jobs" → "Could not fetch jobs".
- API Layer Separation
- Move fetchJobs into a separate api.js service for cleaner code and reusability.
- Polling / Refresh
- You had a commented-out setTimeout for refetching. If you want live updates, consider setInterval or a library like React Query instead of manual polling.
